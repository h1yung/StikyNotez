# StikyNotez
My second Swift 5 iOS App. Conveniently create notecards and sticky notes and manage your notes and reminders all in one view.

Compatibility: Tested for iOS version 13.2 and up.

## Description
StikyNotez is inspired by post-it notes found on bulletin boards / desks. This particular UX design adds extra convenience for users who would like all their notes to be found on one screen.

## Usage
Notecards and Sticky Notes
* Create them using left and right bottom buttons. The square logo creates sticky notes, the rectangle logo creates notecards.
* Cards are their own objects that you can move around and assign text attributes to (unlimited lines).

Drag and Drop Trash Button
* Card becomes slightly transparent when you drag and hover it over the trash button and disappears by fading out when you release.

Delete All
* You can delete all the cards at once by pressing the delete all button, which navigates you to a confirmation page before executing.

## Comments
Some features I just could not find out how to implement include:
* preventing the notes resetting their positions to the center after interacting with the buttons.
* bringing selected notes, originally in the back relative to others, to the front without the problem above from happening.
